    <h1>Dear Ephraim,</h1>

    <div class="letter">
        <p>
Ephraim, my babeâ€¦

Permit me to say my husband ðŸ˜‚. It sounds so good when I call you Oko mi. Iâ€™ve never called anyone else that. It just feels right, like it belongs to you, and only you. If I were close to you right nowâ€¦ if I were sitting across from youâ€¦ if I could look into your eyes and talk to youâ€¦ if I could whisper into your earsâ€¦ if I could let kisses be my wordsâ€¦ if I could give you the cutest eyesâ€¦ if I could read you a letterâ€¦ if I could peel open every layer of my heart to you right now, these would be my words.

My love, Oko mi, Ayo miâ€¦ my babeâ€¦
Since our call ended, Iâ€™ve been lying here with my heart feeling so heavy. I keep replaying my words from tonight, and the more I think about them, the more I realise how wrong they sounded and how much they might have hurt you. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m really sorry. You are my love, my safe place, my joyâ€¦ the last thing I ever want is to hurt you or make you feel misunderstood.

The truth is, what I said tonight didnâ€™t come from how I truly feel about you. You have never made me feel pressured or used. You have never made me feel like I had to give anything I wasnâ€™t ready to give. If anything, youâ€™ve been patient, gentle, and respectful with me in ways I canâ€™t even explain. Youâ€™ve shown me a love so pure that sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve it.

I realise how my words could have made it seem like I doubt you, and I hate that I made you feel that way. You donâ€™t deserve to feel accused or compared to anyone from my past. Youâ€™ve only ever been good to me, and I see that. I know that.

This isnâ€™t the first time Iâ€™ve spoken rashly because of what Iâ€™ve been through, and I hate that Iâ€™ve allowed it to happen again. My feelings about my past are valid, but they should never be used to hurt you. You are not like anyone Iâ€™ve met before, and youâ€™ve never given me a reason to question your intentions. Youâ€™ve only shown me care, respect, love, peace, and consistency.

I love when you are playful with me. I love when you flirt with me. I love when you tell me the things you want because youâ€™re my man and Iâ€™m your woman. Iâ€™m not ashamed of that. In fact, I enjoy it because I know it comes from love, not pressure. What I said tonight came from missing our video calls, from wanting more of you, and instead of just saying that, my emotions spilled in the wrong way. I understand why it hurt you, and Iâ€™m sorry, Oko mi.

Honestly, this year you have been my biggest blessing. My year has been filled with tears, heartbreaks, and disappointmentsâ€¦ but meeting you was one of the best things that happened to me. Youâ€™ve been my light when everything else felt dark. The love I have for you isnâ€™t ending anytime soon, if ever. You are the prayer I didnâ€™t even realise my heart had been praying. You are my joy, my gift from God, my man.

I donâ€™t want you to hold back with me. I want you to still be playful, still be flirty, still be the same man who makes me smile, laugh, and blush. Iâ€™m yours, completely. I love you, Oko miðŸ’œ, Ololufe mi, Adun miðŸ©µ, Ayo miðŸ’–, And I promise to be more mindful of my words so that my past never gets in the way of our love again.

Ayo mi, I value you in ways I canâ€™t explain. You are not my past, you are my present and my future. I want you to still be playful, still tell me the things that make me blush, still be the man who makes me smile for no reason.

Even when youâ€™re tired, you still make time to talk to me. Even if you fall asleep in 10 minutes, you still want to hear my voice first. Youâ€™ve shown me a kind of love and consistency that has softened my heart. Thatâ€™s why it breaks me to know that I made you feel like I was questioning your intentions.

My love, thank you. Thank you for loving me in ways words can barely hold. Thank you for seeing me, hearing me, and choosing me again and again even on days when Iâ€™m not the easiest to love. Thank you for being my safe place when the world feels too heavy.

I want you to know without a single doubt that I love you. I love you in ways I canâ€™t always put into words, in ways that go beyond moments or moods. I care about you more than Iâ€™ve ever cared about anyone, and that will never change.

You mean so much to me more than you probably realise. Youâ€™re not just someone Iâ€™m with, youâ€™re the person my heart feels safe with, the one I want to share my best and my worst days with. I want you to always feel secure knowing Iâ€™m here, not halfway, not conditionally, but completely. I will always be on your side. I will always root for you. I will always hold you close and never let you doubt how much you matter to me.

I love you more than I can ever put into words. And I promise to keep showing you, every single day, just how much you mean to me.

I love you, babe. And Iâ€™m sorry. ðŸ’œ
